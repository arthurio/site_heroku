        <p class="indent">After graduating high school, I decided to enter the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipl%C3%B4me_universitaire_de_technologie" target="_blank" class="icon icon-link">University institute of Technology</a> of Nantes, in order to get a two-year degree in Computer Science. I chose this kind of diploma because it combined theory and practice, and it kept the doors open to continue my studies. Before starting the courses, I was already fond of computers and technology but never knew what programming was. During the two years of studies, the logic behind programming, algorithms and data architecture became a true passion and I knew that I had found the right path for my career.</p>
        <p class="indent">Willing to improve my skills and knowledges about Computer Science, I was able to join the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytech%27Nantes" target="_blank" class="icon icon-link">University of Nantes engineering school</a> thanks to my ranking for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipl%C3%B4me_universitaire_de_technologie" target="_blank" class="icon icon-link">DUT</a> (rank 10/120). Over the years, I took advandage of the internationl partnerships the School has to improve my english. In the second year, I did a six-month project for <a href="https://www.hightail.com/" target="_blank" class="icon icon-link">Hightail (formerly YouSendIt)</a>, a company based in California. Then I did a two-and-a-half-month internship at the <a href="http://en.scut.edu.cn/" target="_blank" class="icon icon-link">South China University of Technology</a>, in Guangzhou. Finally, I did my 9<sup>th</sup> semester (first half of the third year) at <a href="http://lnu.se/?l=en" target="_blank" class="icon icon-link">Linnaeus University</a>, in Sweden.</p>
        <p class="indent">Now that my studies had ended, it was time to find a job and I was really motivated to come work in the Silicon Valey. Therefore, I reached back to Mehdi Ait Oufkir, who was the person that was supervising the Hightail project two years earlier. Fortunately for me, he was just starting a new company, with Ranjith Kumaran, and was looking for a junior software engineer. This is how I ended up working at <a href="http://www.punchtab.com" target="_blank" class="icon icon-link">PunchTab</a> and I'm thankful every day, since they hired me, for the amazing opportunity they've given me!</p>
