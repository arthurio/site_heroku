        <p class="indent"><span class="icon icon-quote-left"></span>PunchTab is the world's first instant loyalty platform reaching over 20 million consumers every month across hundreds of sites that have integrated the company's loyalty programs. Using PunchTab publishers, retailers and application vendors can deploy a tightly integrated reward program to their users in minutes with no development or marketing costs. Consumers can immediately authenticate through popular social networks and start earning loyalty points that are redeemable for exclusive offers, gift cards, and custom rewards.</p>
        <p class="indent">Based in Silicon Valley, PunchTab was founded in January of 2011 by Ranjith Kumaran who previously co-founded YouSendIt.com, the largest digital file-delivery service serving 600,000 subscribers, and Mehdi Ait Oufkir, an early YouSendIt employee who went on to found JellyDo.com, a location-based reminder service for Foursquare users.<span class="icon icon-quote-right"></p>
        <p class="indent">I joined PunchTab end of August 2011, right after college, and we were only 4 at this time: Ranjith, Mehdi, Ben and me. First job, first time in the US, seven-month-old startup, you can't imagine how excited I was to start this adventure.</p>
        <p class="indent">When you start at PunchTab, the first rule you are taught is that you need to push something in production during your first week. This is an awesome way of making you feeling 100% involved in the company and makes you realize that you have a huge responsability regarding its growth. I quickly started to work on the <a href="http://www.punchtab.com/giveaway-page" target="_blank" class="icon icon-link">giveaway widget</a> and it's still my cherished product that I love to maintain and improve as soon as I have some free time.</p>
